# Online Sudoku Solver

Welcome to Sudoku Solver! I built this application because I was captivated by backtracking algorithms and wanted to learn more and see them in action.
I hope you enjoy using this application as much as I had fun building it. You can access it here: <a href="https://luisalfonsopreciado.github.io/SudokuSolver/">Complete Project</a>
